# Wall-Maze-Solver-Robot

- Robotics is an interdisciplinary research area at the interface of computer science and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep everyone safe.

- A maze solving robot is designed to move in a maze and escape through it by following its walls. A maze solving robot is quite similar to a line follower. Like a line follower has to follow black strip lines, a maze follower finds a wall and starts following it until it finds an escape route.

We live in a World of Sensors. You can find different types of Sensors in our homes, offices, cars etc. working to make our lives easier by turning on the lights by detecting our presence, adjusting the room temperature, detect smoke or fire, make us delicious coffee, open garage doors as soon as our car is near the door and many other tasks.All these and many other automation tasks are possible because of Sensors. Before going in to the details of What is a Sensor, What are the Different Types of Sensors and Applications of these different types of Sensors, we will first take a look at a simple example of an automated system, which is possible because of Sensors (and many other components as well).
