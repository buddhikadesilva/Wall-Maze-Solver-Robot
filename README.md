# Wall-Maze-Solver-Robot

- A maze solving robot is designed to move in a maze and escape through it by following its walls. A maze solving robot is quite similar to a line follower. Like a line follower has to follow black strip lines, a maze follower finds a wall and starts following it until it finds an escape route.
